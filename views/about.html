                        Our mission is to bring hope, strength, and healing to children battling cancer and their families. 
                        We are committed to providing compassionate psycho-social support through counseling, education, play, 
                        and community engagement to ease the emotional and social burdens of treatment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By creating safe, nurturing spaces—where children can learn, laugh, and find moments of joy even during 
                        difficult times—we support resilience, dignity, and emotional recovery. Our services include hospital-based 
                        classroom and play programs, therapeutic support, festive ward events, and community outreach initiatives.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Guided by love, empathy, and a deep sense of purpose, we stand beside every child and family, helping them 
                        face cancer with courage and hope. We strive to build a kinder, more supportive journey toward brighter tomorrows.

                    <p>
                        In 2015, Dr. Zainab Umer tragically lost her son, Esa Kamal, to neuroblastoma. 
                        From this deeply personal loss, she found the strength to transform her grief into purpose. 
                        Determined to make a difference for children and families facing the same struggles, 
                        she established the Childhood Cancer Care Foundation to provide vital psycho-social 
                        support to young cancer patients.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What began as a vision has grown into a source of hope and comfort. 
                        With a dedicated classroom and playroom inside the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Rawalpindi, 
                        along with a small office to serve families, the foundation creates a safe space 
                        for children to learn, laugh, and heal. Today, it continues to nurture resilience 
                        and courage, standing beside countless children in their battles against cancer.

                        We provide dedicated psychosocial support for children undergoing cancer treatment and their families. 
                        Through counseling, therapy, and compassionate guidance, we help them navigate the emotional challenges 
                        that accompany diagnosis and treatment, offering comfort, strength, and hope at every step of their journey.
